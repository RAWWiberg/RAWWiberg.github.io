Last month the biggest excitement was the annual DrosEU meeting which is always great fun. There were many interesting contributions from members and several new faces.

It was very fun to see that several projects were underway that used both the isofemale line resources that the group has generated and the populagion genomic resources that have been published as the [DEST](https://dest.bio/) data-set. There are also two major consortium papers that should be out very soon, so keep your eyes open!

I also had some great press for my recent [paper in *Evolution*](https://academic.oup.com/evolut/advance-article-pdf/doi/10.1093/evolut/qpae133/59459334/qpae133.pdf). A press-officer at Gothenburg University found the article and thought it was very exciting. They helped us prepare a press release which was picked up first by [Newsweek](https://www.newsweek.com/evolution-flies-male-female-sharpen-eyesight-2026374) and then by the Swedish wire service TT who included the story, with a few more quotes from an interview with me, in a press package. The TT story was then included in various places in the swedish press including [Aftonbladet](https://www.aftonbladet.se/nyheter/a/73orm4/damernas-raggknep-stor-mage-och-hariga-ben), and [GÃ¶teborgs-posten](https://www.gp.se/nyheter/sverige/damernas-raggknep-stor-mage-och-hariga-ben.dab59e8d-a5ba-518d-bd8d-effcf32ccbf7). It even made it to Swedish-language media in Finland, appearing as a story, in print, in Hufvudstadsbladet (14 Feb. 2025. s. 22).
